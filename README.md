## :zap: DNS Blocklists - For a better internet!

### Made with :heartbeat: for a safer and cleaner internet! It always seems impossible until it’s done.

Privacy is not a crime, protect yourself. Privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be :bangbang:

If you like the project and you can benefit from it, leave a :star: (top right) and become a [stargazer](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/stargazers)! Thanks for your support!

### :books: **Multi - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy!** <a name="overview"></a>

An all-in-one DNS blocklist in **various versions (light, normal, pro, pro++ and ultimate)**. It can be used as a standalone blocklist. For every region. Blocks ads, affiliate, tracking, metrics, telemetry, fake, phishing, malware, scam, cryptojacking and other "crap". Based on [various blocklists](sources.md). No, they are not just block lists cobbled together from different sources. They have been optimized and extended to efficiently "clean the Internet" in all areas.             

See also: [Which sources are used for the lists and how are the lists compiled on the basis of these sources?](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#sources)

### :green_book: **Multi LIGHT** - **Basic protection** <a name="light"></a>

Hand brush - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Tracking, Metrics and some Badware. A size-optimized version of the Multi NORMAL.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Relaxed              
> This list version should not lead to any restrictions. It is particularly suitable for environments in which there is no admin nearby who can unblock something and if you have to pay attention to the size of the list, because the AdBlocker does not support large lists.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Does not block error trackers such as Bugsnag, Crashlytics, Firebase, Instabug, Sentry, ... and other app-specific crash trackers. These are only blocked from the Pro version onwards.

### :ledger: **Multi PRO** - **Extended protection (Recommended)** <a name="pro"></a>

Big broom - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced            
> This list version should only very rarely lead to restrictions. It is suitable for environments where there is an admin nearby who can unblock something. My personal recommendation for mostly problem-free adblocking with good privacy protection.

### :orange_book: **Multi PRO++** - **Maximum protection** <a name="proplus"></a>

Sweeper - Aggressive cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced/Aggressive              
> More aggressive version of the Multi PRO blocklist. It may contain a few false positive domains that limit functionality. Therefore it should only be used by experienced users. Furthermore, an admin should be available to unblock incorrectly blocked domains.

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**           
> A few referral domains that also function as normal trackers are blocked. For further details see: [Referral domains](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#referral)

### :closed_book: **Multi ULTIMATE** - **Aggressive protection** <a name="ultimate"></a>

Ultimate Sweeper - Strictly cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Aggressive              
> Stricter version of the Multi PRO++ blocklist. It contains domains that limit functionality in apps and on websites - some popular trackers, that lead to restrictions, are blocked in this list. Therefore it should only be used by experienced users. Furthermore, an admin should be available to unblock incorrectly blocked domains.       

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**           
> A few referral domains that also function as normal trackers are blocked. For further details see: [Referral domains](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#referral)
>                   
> **Facebook:**          
> Some META trackers are blocked in Ultimate. This restricts the use of Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps. Furthermore, the Whatsapp graph trackers are blocked, which leads to restrictions when creating avatars, using the in-app helpcenter and using video effects. Otherwise, blocking has no effect on Whatsapp functionalities. To use META apps with Ultimate, unblock the following domains if necessary: [META Tracker](share/facebook.txt)
>           
> **Windows/XBox:**          
> Some Microsoft trackers are blocked in Ultimate, which lead to restrictions, e.g. Windows Spotlight, XBox Live Achievements Activity History and others. For details and which domains must be unblocked for which function, see: [Microsoft Tracker](share/microsoft.txt).
>                   
> **Location and IP trackers:**                           
> Certain location and IP trackers used by websites to identify or monitor your IP address and geographic location are blocked. This enhances privacy but may lead to issues such as incorrect regional settings, additional CAPTCHAs, or reduced website functionality. These trackers are commonly employed for hidden analytics and targeted advertising.
>                    
>**Miscellaneous:**          
> Details on other known issues can be found [here](share/ultimate-known-issues.txt).

### :new: **Newly Registered Domains (NRD)** <a name="nrd"></a>

Newly registered domains (NRDs) are commonly used by threat actors for phishing, malware, and command-and-control infrastructure due to their disposable nature, which helps evade detection.
        
> [!WARNING]
> These lists are very large and resource-intensive. They may cause high memory usage and contain false positives, since some legitimate domains are newly registered. Use with caution and whitelist critical services as needed.
             
> [!CAUTION]
> Use at your own risk. The NRD lists are provided as-is, without guarantees, support, or a process for removing false positives.

### :computer: **Badware Hoster blocking - Protects against the malicious use of host services!** <a name="hoster"></a>

A blocklist for blocking known hosters that also host badware via user content to prevent the use of these hosters for malicious purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This list blocks the root domains of all hosting providers that occasionally appear in threat intelligence feeds due to malicious subdomains. Please be aware that this will also block legitimate sites hosted by these providers. Consider this carefully before using the list.
>                 
> When using this list, users are responsible for unblocking any required subdomains themselves.
 
> [!CAUTION]
> Blocking entire hosting providers is impractical in normal environments and may disrupt legitimate services. In sensitive environments, however, stricter blocking can be justified to maximize security.

> Not suitable for use in standard environments. Blocking all URL shorteners is recommended mainly in highly sensitive environments, as they can hide link destinations and facilitate attacks. In less sensitive settings, monitoring, selective blocking, or user education usually suffice to manage risks.
>                 
> When using this list, users are responsible for unblocking any required domains themselves.

### :crystal_ball: **Most Abused TLDs - Protects against known malicious Top Level Domains! (Recommended)** <a name="tlds"></a>

A blocklist for blocking Top Most Abused Top Level Domains, merged from [@Yokoffing](https://github.com/yokoffing), [@DandelionSprout](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/), [@LennyFox](https://github.com/lennyfox) Cloudflare Radar, Netcraft and SpamHaus.

> [!WARNING]
> The Most Abused TLDs list is designed to block entire top-level domains (such as *.top, *.shop, *.gdn) with poor reputations. While this may also block some legitimate sites, it is highly effective at preventing spam, scams, phishing, malware, and other malicious content. Users should be aware of which sites are affected by this list.
>
> Only widely-used, reputable domains, such as those appearing on major top lists (Umbrella, Cloudflare, Tranco, Chrome, DomCop, etc.) or those essential for popular apps and services will be considered for exclusion. Illegal domains, including those related to piracy, will not be unblocked. Domains that do not meet these criteria are reviewed individually; if exclusion is not justified, they remain blocked. Users who need access to such domains should add them to their personal allowlist.
>
> This selective approach is necessary because AdGuard and uBlock Origin have technical limits on rule length when using denyallow/domain modifiers. Attempting to exclude every legitimate domain would eventually break important rules, so exclusions must be limited and carefully chosen.

### :shield: **DNS Rebind Protection - Prevents attackers from resolving domains to local IPs!** <a name="dnsrebind"></a>

DNS Rebind Protection is a security mechanism that prevents attackers from manipulating DNS responses to make a domain resolve to private or local IP addresses, thereby blocking malicious scripts from accessing internal networks through DNS rebinding attacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This list is only compatible with AdGuard/AdGuard Home and can also be selected in AdGuard DNS.                  
> Other DNS blockers may include built‑in DNS rebinding protection.            
>          
> Since rebinding protection blocks all domains resolving to local IPs, internal hostnames may also be affected.           
> In AdGuard, you should therefore whitelist your local domains, for example: `@@||fritz.box^`

### :bulb: **Recommendation** <a name="recommendation"></a>

As a network-wide DNS blocker, I recommend using [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), [TechnitiumDNS](https://technitium.com/dns/), [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) (advanced users), [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean) (OpenWrt) or [eBlocker](https://eblocker.org/).

DNS blockers offer good protection of privacy by blocking tracking, metrics and telemetry. They can be used to block the vast majority of ads, malware, scam, fake and co, but not everything can be blocked at the DNS level!
Therefore, I **additionally** recommend the use of a browser content blocker such as [AdGuard](https://adguard.com), [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com) or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/).

Check out Yokoffing's [Recommended Filters for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists) for content blocker filter lists.

The blocklists are based on [various sources](sources.md) and my own denylists/extensions. They were designed to avoid false positive domains as much as possible without losing effectiveness and efficiency. Dead hosts are regularly removed from the lists to keep them as small as possible.
Made with :heartbeat: for a safer and cleaner internet.

All lists were tested against 10000 websites from the Cisco Umbrella Top 1 million list. It was checked whether the pages load, the page content is displayed correctly, navigation links work, images load, videos start and much more.

No, they are not just block lists cobbled together from different sources. They have been optimized and extended to efficiently "clean the Internet" in all areas. See also: [Which sources are used for the lists and how are the lists compiled on the basis of these sources?](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#sources)

The results of a test against the 10000 [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me/websites.html) pages. All pages were opened and fully loaded via batch in Edge with privacy features turned off. Cookies were all accepted.
